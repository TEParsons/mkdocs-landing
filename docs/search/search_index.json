Configuration With Landing I've tried to expose as much of the styling as possible to mkdocs, so that you can change up the theme to your own personal style as much as possible. Of course, there's nothing more flexible than writing your own css, so if you hit a wall with the config file I've also tried to make the html as simple as possible so you can easily add your own custom CSS. Click here for a full list of configuration options available. Using preset configurations If you're not after super cusomisation, the mkdocs-landing package also includes a plugin which lets you choose from a set of pre-defined configurations (\"presets\"). I've tried to make this system easy to plug into too (for those in the know : the entry point is mkdocs_landing.presets and the base class is mkdocs_landing.presets.base.BaseLandingPreset ), so in time I hope there'll eventually be people adding their own presets to Landing! To use a preset, add this to your mkdocs.yaml file: plugins: - landing-preset: name: <name of your chosen preset> Click here for a list of all presets available and previews of how they look. Adding a links page If you'd like to add a links page, similar to LinkTree or Campsite , you can do so using Landing! Click here for more information and examples of how the links look. History Landing came out of me wanting to use mkdocs for my own personal landing page - I made a custom .css file to sit alongside a generic mkdocs file and style it the way I wanted it. When implementing a similar page for a friend I realised that this basic structure could be fairly easily modified with a few key parameters to match a variety of different aesthetics. Gallery Below are some implementations of Landing with various styles, as an example. Todd Parsons The configuration I've got on my own personal site - not all that different than default Landing, but note the different header layout (I made my avatar slightly bigger and changed the order via the avatar_size and layout parameters) Full page Config file Torillic links To show off how a links page can look, here's an example page which links to the various implementations of my D&D-inspired theme, Torillic . Full page Config file Ben Ambrose A site I built for a friend - this one relies on content being in <article> tags, and got a little funky with the background_gradient parameter.

Click here for a general guide on using mkdocs and the mkdocs.yaml configuration file. Header The below parameters are for configuring the layout and appearance of the header, which appears at the top of the main homepage of your site. header_layout The header is laid out in a grid with three columns; the outer columns are each the width of your avatar (defined in avatar_size ), the middle column is the remaining space. Within the header are several different \"elements\" - this parameter defines which elements are included and in what order they are laid out. The elements available are: avatar (1 column wide): The image defined in avatar tagline (2 columns wide): The markdown text defined in tagline nav (2 columns wide): Top level links from the site-wide navigation defined in nav (in general config) title (2 columns wide): The name of your site defined in site_name (in general config) socials (2 columns wide): Social media links defined in socials You can also include a blank list item to put an empty div tag if you need to fill a column. Once an element spans past the final column, it is moved to the row below in order to fit. The image below shows how the header on this site is laid out, with the grid visible thanks to Google Chrome's \"inspect\" tool: So the first row has the avatar (1 column wide) and the tagline (2 columns wide), forcing the title (2 columns wide) onto the next row. As there is only 1 column left on this row and the social links are 2 columns wide, they are forced onto the next row. avatar Image of yourself, this will appear in the heading of the main page. avatar_size The width of the avatar, default is 8rem. round_avatar If True, then the avatar will be cropped into a circle. tagline A markdown string to be displayed in the header, smaller than the title. For professional profiles, this might be your job title or demographic information (e.g. pronouns, name pronunciation). socials List of social links to include, should be in the format: - label: <text to display if the icon doesn't load> link: <url to link to when clicked> icon: <name of the icon to use, from fontawesome> All of the free fontawesome icons are supported, you can also use [\"brands\", <icon name>] to use a brand logo instead (such as GitHub, Facebook, BlueSky, etc.) Content box The below parameters are for configuring the content box, which contains the content of your site (and the header) and sits in front of the background. content_box_opacity The box containing your site content will always be color you define for base_color , this parameter controls how opaque it is over the background. content_box_padding The distance between the horizontal edges of your content and the edges of the content box. border_left / border_right The border on either side of the content box (defined using the same syntax as in border-left / border-right in CSS). Background The below parameters are for configuring the background of your site, which sits behind the content box. background Background for the whole page, . Syntax is the same as the CSS background property. By default, the background color of your site will be the color you define for base_color and there is no background image. background_color Color override for background . Whatever value is in here will be used for the CSS background-color property (which overrides any color set in background ). background_image Image override for background . Whatever value is in here will be used for the CSS background-image property (which overrides any color set in background ). Unlike background , you do not need to include the url(...) wrapper - just a file path will suffice. Background gradient The background gradient is a gradient overlay which sits on top of your background but still behind the content box. background_gradient_angle The angle of the background gradient, by default this will be 45\u00b0 (i.e. from bottom left to top right). background_gradient_colors The colors comprising the background gradient, as a list. These will be evenly spaced out, but you can use the same color multiple times to have it occupy more space. You can use any CSS color syntax, including transparent and color-mix(<color 1> <amount>%, <color 2>) . The default colors are: Your mantle_color at 80% opacity transparent Your crust_color at 20% opacity Footer The below parameters are for configuring the content of the footer, which appears at the bottom of all pages on your site. footer Markdown content to include in the page footer page_source Optionally add a link to this page's source code, for example on GitHub. Can be specified as either: page_source: link: <link to your page source> or page_source: link: <link to your page source> icon: [<fontawesome icon group>, <fontawesome icon tag>] If specified without icon , the icon will default to the GitHub logo (equivalent to icon: [brands, github] ) Colors Scheme colors The defining colors of your theme, ordered by importance. They're used for things like link colors, borders and hover effects. The attributes for scheme colors are: primary_color secondary_color tertiary_color By default, these are: primary_color secondary_color tertiary_color #05b2dc #ef9B0f #ef3e36 Shades Various shades of white (or black in dark mode) to use for backgrounds and faint outlines. These should start with base_color and get progressively lighter/darker from there. The attributes for shades are: base_color mantle_color crust_color overlay_color By default, these are: base_color mantle_color crust_color overlay_color Light #ffffff #e5e4e5 #c4c2c5 #9B9B9E Dark #343233 #373536 #3E3C3D #646461 Text colors Colors to use for text in your site, one for the majority of text, another for text which is over a highlighted background. The two attributes for main text colors are: text_color hltext_color By default, these are: text_color hltext_color Light #343233 #ffffff Dark #ffffff #343233 Background-specific text colors Each of the colors above has a matching parameter which is its name with _color replaced by _text_color (e.g. primary_text_color rather than primary_color ), which defines the color for text when against that background color. These default to being either text_color or hltext_color , with the following defaults: primary_text_color : hltext secondary_text_color : hltext tertiary_text_color : hltext base_text_color : text mantle_text_color : text crust_text_color : text overlay_text_color : hltext Darkmode colors To define the colors which are used in darkmode, use the same parameter names but with _dark on the end (e.g. primary_color_dark rather than primary_color ) Fonts The following attributes define the font faces used in your site. Each of these can be the name of any font from Google Fonts heading_font Font to use for headings, default is Poppins body_font Font to use for most text, default is Hind mono_font Monospace font to use for code, default is JetBrains Mono emoji_font Font to use for emojis, default is Noto Color Emoji, which is packaged with Landing (i.e. no Google Fonts loading needed) and looks like this: \ud83e\udd70\ud83d\udc80\u270c\ufe0f\ud83c\udf34\ud83d\udc22\ud83d\udc10\ud83c\udf44\u26bd\ud83c\udf7b\ud83d\udc51\ud83d\udcf8\ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udea8\ud83c\udfe1\ud83d\udd4a\ufe0f\ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\ude3b\ud83c\udf1f\ud83e\uddff\ud83c\udf40\ud83c\udfa8\ud83c\udf5c Local fonts To use fonts from a local file rather than Google Fonts (which you may want to do for loading speed or GDPR in the EU), you can point to the file using the relevant parameter name with _files on the end (e.g. body_font_files for body_font ). This parameter should be a set of subparameters for each font style you want to specify a file for ( regular , bold , italic and bold_italic ), using the path to the font file you want to use, relative to your site root. For example: body_font: Noto Sans body_font_files: regular: assets/fonts/NotoSans_Regular.tff bold: assets/fonts/NotoSans_Bold.tff italic: assets/fonts/NotoSans_Italictff bold_italic: assets/fonts/NotoSans_BoldItalic.tff A note about emojis... emoji_font_files only uses regular as emojis only come in one weight and style. Other favicon Image in the browser tab, should be a path to an image file, ideally a 16x16px .png file. toc_level How many levels to include in a page-level table of contents? Use 0 to hide the table of contents altogether, use 1 to only show top level headings, use 2 to show top level headings and (when hovered) show the headings under each. share_btn Whether or not to include a share ( ) button in the top right of each page.
